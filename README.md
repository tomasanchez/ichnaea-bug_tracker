# Ichnaea Issue Tracker

This is a Java application for issue tracking. It is designed to be used by Project Managers and Developers to track
issues and their status.

## Credits

This project was made with ðŸ’™ by [Tomas Sanchez](https://github.com/tomasanchez).

Special thanks to [DJ-Raven](https://github.com/DJ-Raven) as his work inspired the different UI elements, most of the
components' logic was developed for his [raven-project](https://github.com/DJ-Raven/raven-project) , where I merely
adapted it to my needs and implemented on
Kotlin.

UI elements were inspired by [Material Design](https://material.io/design/).
And [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) looks and feels.

MVC logic is based on my previous [jpa-template](https://github.com/tomasanchez/jpa-template) project, which
itself was based
on [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
